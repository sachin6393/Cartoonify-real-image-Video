# Cartoonify-real-image-Video
INTRODUCTION
Cartoon is a popular art form that has been widely applied in diverse scenes. Modern cartoon
animation workflows allow artists to use a variety of sources to create
content.
Some famous products have been created by turning real-world photography into usable
cartoon scene materials, where the process is called image cartoonization.
Social media is extensively used these days. And standing out in this online crowd has al-
ways been a to-do on every userâ€™s list on these social media platforms.
Be it images, blog posts, artwork, tweets, memes, opinions and what not being used
to seek attention of followers or friends to create influence or to connect with them on such
social platforms.
Cartoons are commonly used in various kinds of applications. As we know cartoons are artis-
tically made it requires elegant and fine human artistic skills. While portraying Cartoons in
any animated movies it gets time-consuming for the artist as they need to define the sketch of
the cartoon properly to get a good result. We all know that animation plays an important role
in the world of cinema, so to overcome the problem faced by the artist we have created a
program with the help of GAN which not only converts images but also converts video into
an animation.
We have given one such creative solution to their needs, which is applying cartoon like
effects to their images. Users can later share these images on any social media platforms,
messengers, keep it for themselves, share it with loved ones or do whatever they like with it.
